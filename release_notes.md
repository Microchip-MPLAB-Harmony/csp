### Notes

-  Removed weak declaration for interrupts that are enabled in NVIC to enforce definition of interrupt handlers for MISRA C Required rules compliance. Any interrupts that are enabled without a corresponding interrupt handler will result in build error and hence the unused interrupts must be disabled.

### Known Issues

The current known issues are as follows:
* Flash wait states are now calculated as part of respective flash Plib(EFC/NVMCTRL) instead of clock manager for SAM microcontrollers. Older projects must be reconfigured to add the respective Flash Plib to the project graph.
* Interactive help using the Show User Manual Entry in the Right-click menu for configuration options provided by this module is not yet available from within the MPLAB Harmony Configurator (MHC). Please see the *Configuring the Library* section in the help documentation in the doc folder for this Harmony 3 module instead. Help is available in both CHM and PDF formats.
* ATSAMA5D2C and SAM9X60 example applications build with a warning message: ```Warning[Pe111]: statement is unreachable for return ( EXIT_FAILURE ); statement of main() in IAR```
